This form takes seconds and displays their number depending on the input.  If 
more than 86,400 it will display the number of days, if more than 3600
the number of hours, and if more than 60 the number of minutes.

Revised Activity 4:

Removed null statements, replaces ifs with else if as suggested, and switched placement of else if statements.  This 
proved effective in getting correct output.
